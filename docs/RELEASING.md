# Releasing Winglet

Pushing a tag like `v0.1.1` builds the Android APK and the plugin bundle and publishes them as a
GitHub Release. The tag sets the app version: `v0.1.1` becomes version `0.1.1`, Android versionCode
`101` (major × 10000 + minor × 100 + patch), so every release installs as an update over the last.

## One-time setup: your signing key

Android only installs an update if it's signed with the same key as the version already installed,
and the key proves the APK came from you. CI refuses to publish a release without it.

1. Create a key (needs Java; any machine works). Keep the file and passwords somewhere safe and
   **never commit them**. If you lose this key, users have to uninstall to get future updates.

   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore winglet-release.keystore -alias winglet \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
   ```

2. Turn it into text for GitHub:

   ```bash
   base64 -w0 winglet-release.keystore > keystore.txt   # macOS: base64 -i winglet-release.keystore
   ```

3. In the repo on GitHub: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**,
   add four secrets:

   | Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | contents of `keystore.txt` |
   | `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | the keystore password |
   | `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | `winglet` |
   | `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | the key password |

## Cutting a release

```bash
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

Manual runs from the Actions tab build test artifacts only. Without the key secrets those APKs are
signed with the public debug key and named `…-debugkey.apk`: fine for trying things out, not for
sharing.
