# Winglet plugin for Hermes Agent

This folder is a [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) plugin. It adds
**Winglet** as a messaging platform, the same way Telegram or Discord plug in, so everything
Hermes already does (sessions, approvals, questions, routines) reaches your phone.

What it adds on your server:

- A small HTTP/WebSocket server for the app (default port `8787`)
- QR-code pairing (`hermes winglet pair`)
- Push notifications: Web Push for the iPhone/desktop web app, ntfy for Android
- One-tap approvals and answers to the agent's questions
- Hosting for the installable web app

Approval cards capture the exact request ID at current Hermes' notification handoff. If that
handoff is unsupported or the request has expired, Hermes sends its typed approval instructions.
See [approval compatibility](../docs/APPROVALS.md).

## Install

```bash
hermes plugins install VIKASRP24/winglet/plugin
hermes plugins enable winglet
hermes winglet setup
hermes gateway restart        # or: hermes gateway run
hermes winglet pair           # scan the QR code with your phone
```

Hermes prepares the declared server, push and QR-code dependencies when installing/enabling
the plugin. Accept its dependency preparation prompt. You do not need a separate `pip install`.
`setup` checks every dependency before enabling Winglet and prepares missing packages through
Hermes's package manager. If Hermes needs a fresh process after preparing them, setup tells
you to rerun it and does not report success prematurely.

For an existing installation, run `hermes plugins update winglet` before setup so Hermes can
read the new dependency declaration. Restart the gateway after updating. Updating the plugin
does not update an installed Android APK; install a newer APK separately when available.

Dependency readiness does not establish remote access. The pairing address still needs to be
reachable from the phone; see [remote access](../docs/REMOTE_ACCESS.md) for HTTPS options.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `hermes winglet setup [--port N] [--public-url URL]` | Enable Winglet for this profile |
| `hermes winglet pair` | Show a QR code + one-time code (10 minutes) |
| `hermes winglet devices` | List paired phones |
| `hermes winglet unpair <id>` | Remove a phone |
| `hermes winglet status` | Is it running, and at which URL |

## Settings

Set in `~/.hermes/.env` (or per profile):

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `WINGLET_ENABLED` | – | `true` to start with the gateway |
| `WINGLET_PORT` | `8787` | |
| `WINGLET_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | |
| `WINGLET_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://<lan-ip>:8787` | The address encoded in pairing QR codes |
| `WINGLET_NTFY_SERVER` | `https://ntfy.sh` | For Android notifications |

For live-typing replies, add to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    winglet:
      streaming: true
```

## Multiple bots

Each Hermes profile is a bot. Run a gateway per profile with its own port
(`hermes -p researcher winglet setup --port 8788`), then pair each one. They all show up in the
app's sidebar.
